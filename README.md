# CV Editor

A local-first CV editor: YAML on the left, a print-ready CV on the right. Everything
runs in the browser — no network calls, no CDN, no account.

Grown out of `template-artifact.html` (kept in the repo for reference), with three
changes: the compact/full version toggle is gone, every library is bundled from npm
instead of a CDN, and the document is now a [Loro](https://loro.dev) CRDT persisted
to `localStorage` with a version history.

## Running it

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173
pnpm build      # static site in build/
pnpm check      # svelte-check
```

## How it works

| Concern            | Where                                                                                        |

| Document + history | [src/lib/cv/doc.svelte.js](src/lib/cv/doc.svelte.js) — Loro doc, persistence, cross-tab merge |
| Editor             | [src/lib/components/YamlEditor.svelte](src/lib/components/YamlEditor.svelte) — CodeMirror 6   |
| YAML to HTML       | [src/lib/cv/render.js](src/lib/cv/render.js)                                                 |

| CV document CSS    | [src/lib/cv/cv.css](src/lib/cv/cv.css) — global, since the sheet is injected as raw HTML     |

### Editor and document

The editor is CodeMirror 6, bound to the document by
[loro-codemirror](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-codemirror). That binding owns
both directions of text sync and the undo stack, so nothing in this codebase watches
keystrokes: `LoroExtensions(doc, undefined, undoManager, cvText)` is the whole wiring.
CodeMirror's own `history()` is deliberately left out — the binding installs Loro's
undo at high precedence, and two undo stacks would fight over Ctrl+Z.

Syntax colours are a `HighlightStyle` whose values are CSS custom properties, so one
style serves both themes; the `--cm-*` tokens live in `src/app.css`.

### Versions

The binding commits on every editor transaction, so history granularity comes from
Loro's change-merge window: unnamed commits inside 45 seconds fold into one change,
making history read as one entry per editing burst. Loro never merges anything into a
change that carries a message, so named versions always stand alone.

Naming a version writes into a `checkpoints` map container and commits that with a
message. The map operation is what gives the commit something real to carry — a bare
`commit()` with nothing pending creates no change at all, so "name this version"
would silently do nothing without it.

Reset and Restore can't mutate the text container directly: the binding ignores
`local` events, so a direct write would never reach the editor. Both instead push
text in as an ordinary editor transaction and label the resulting commit through
`subscribePreCommit`. Restore reads the old text with `forkAt`, which leaves the live
document untouched.

Clicking a version checks it out — the document detaches and the editor goes
read-only until you go back to the latest or restore. Restoring is additive; nothing
is discarded.

### Persistence

The whole document, history included, is exported as a Loro snapshot and base64'd
into `localStorage` on a 400 ms debounce, plus synchronously on tab close. Open the
editor in two tabs and they merge through the `storage` event — that is the CRDT
earning its keep rather than decorating. The stored value carries a lineage marker so
that "Clear history" in one tab replaces the document in the others instead of
merging two unrelated ones.

## Dependencies

All bundled locally — the only WASM/asset URL is same-origin.

`loro-crdt` ships several builds. `loro-codemirror` imports the bare specifier, which
resolves to a build that loads its WASM with a synchronous main-thread XHR, and would
be a *second* WASM instance whose objects the first instance cannot accept. The alias
in [vite.config.js](vite.config.js) pins every importer to the async `web` build, so
exactly one `.wasm` is emitted. `optimizeDeps.exclude` is there because pre-bundling
rewrites the `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` the build uses to find that file.
